# Folland_RA_Solutions
This contains my solutions to exercises in folland's real analysis textbook. The main two reasons backing this repositories existence are that it serves as proof of me having experience in this topic which I can not take a course in, and also my need to look up solutions to past exercises and having to dig through a mound of scrap paper.
The "main" file is just the rest of the files stitched together.
Solutions to new chapters will be uploaded one at a time, or maybe one section at a time.
I do not guarantee that these are all correct, however they have been reviewed atleast twice before being pushed. Please feel free to point out errors, you will be doing me a great service. Stylistic/soft suggestions are also welcome.
